This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our notes-taking application available on Google Play. By using the App, you consent to the practices described in this policy.

We comply with applicable laws, including Google's User Data Policy. If you have questions, contact us at abdullahmanzoor.code@gmail.com.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide and improve the App's functionality. All collection is disclosed here and in the Google Play Data Safety section. We only collect data necessary for the App's core features.

### 1.1 Personal Information
- **User-Generated Content (Notes and Attachments):** When you create notes, we store the text, images, audio recordings, or other attachments you add. 
  - **How Collected:** Directly from you via the App's input fields, camera, microphone, or file picker.  
  - **Why Necessary:** To enable note creation, editing, search, and organization.  
  - **Local vs. Cloud:** By default, all notes and attachments are **stored locally on your device** using a secure database. If you use the backup/export feature, data is processed only to generate the requested file.
  - **Disclosure:** We do not scan or analyze note content for advertising.

### 1.2 Device and Usage Information
- **Device Identifiers:** Device model, OS version, and app version.  
  - **How Collected:** Automatically when the App launches.  
  - **Why Necessary:** For performance optimization and ensuring compatibility across different Android versions.

- **Permissions-Based Data:**  
  - **Storage/Media Permissions:** Access to photos and files for attaching media to notes. 
  - **Camera/Microphone Permissions:** Access to camera for photos or microphone for voice notes. 
  - **Location Permissions:** Used for optional geotagging of notes to help you remember where a note was created.
  - **Text Recognition:** The App uses on-device Google ML Kit for text recognition in images. This processing happens entirely on your device; images are not sent to our servers for this purpose.

### 1.3 Information Not Collected
- **No Third-Party Advertising Data:** We do not collect or share data with third-party ad networks.
- **No Contact/Calendar Scraping:** We do not access your contacts or calendar without explicit future features and permissions.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected information solely to provide, maintain, and improve the App. Specific uses include:
- **Core Functionality:** Storing, editing, searching, and organizing your notes locally.
- **Personalization:** Remembering your preferences (e.g., themes or sort order) on your device.
- **Security and Support:** Detecting crashes and responding to support requests via error logs.

Note content is **never** used for AI training or external analysis by us.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties. Sharing occurs only in limited cases:
- **Legal Requirements:** If required by law, subpoena, or government request.
- **With Your Consent:** For example, if you choose to share a note using the Android "Share" menu to another application of your choice.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

- **Local Data:** Notes and device data are stored on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App. 
- **Deletion Rights:** You can delete individual notes or perform a "Clear Data" in Android settings to remove all information.
- **Uninstall:** If you uninstall the App, all local data (SQLite database and local media) is removed automatically by the Android system.

## 5. Security Practices

- **Local Encryption:** We use industry-standard practices to protect the local database.
- **ProGuard/R8:** We use code obfuscation to protect the integrity of the App's logic.
- **Permissions:** Permissions are requested only when you trigger a feature that requires them (e.g., clicking the camera icon).

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we discover such collection, we will delete it promptly.

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

- **Access and Control:** View, edit, or delete your notes anytime in the App.
- **Permissions:** Revoke permissions (e.g., location) in Android settings at any time.
