PHASE 3: USER FLOW SCENARIO TESTING & VERIFICATION
================================================================================
Date: February 19, 2026, 17:00 UTC
Status: BEGINNING COMPREHENSIVE FLOW TESTING
Total Flows: 52

================================================================================
PHASE 3 OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Phase 3 Tests: Multi-step user journeys
Goal: Verify features work TOGETHER (integration testing)
Scope: All 52 user flows from uerflow.txt
Method: Code examination + integration point validation
Issue Resolution: Fix critical integration issues immediately

All individual stories (Phase 2) verified ✅
Now testing: How features interact across the app

================================================================================
PHASE 3 FLOW CATEGORIES (52 Total)

  - Export and sharing
  - Data management

================================================================================
FLOW TESTING METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

For EACH Flow:
1. Read the user story (what they expect)
2. Examine relevant BLoC event handlers
3. Trace data flow through repositories
4. Verify persistence mechanisms
5. Check error handling
6. Identify integration points

Flag as:
  ✅ COMPLETE — Full integration working
  ⏳ REQUIRES VERIFICATION — Need to trace code
  ⚠️  INTEGRATION ISSUE — Feature gap found
  ❌ BROKEN — Critical path broken

================================================================================
CROSS-FEATURE INTEGRATION TESTING
================================================================================

These flows test MULTIPLE features working together:

CRITICAL PATHS TO VERIFY:
  1. Create Note + Add Reminder + Get Notification ✅ (Phase 2 verified)
  2. Create Todo + Set Due Date + Get Reminder
  3. Create Todo + Complete → Auto-cancel reminder
  4. Focus Session + Background App + Timer Accuracy (FIX F008 verified ✅)
  5. Create Note → Export as PDF → Share
  6. Add Media (photo/audio) → Link to Note → Export
  7. Create Smart Collection → Auto-populate → Save
  8. Backup → Modify Data → Restore → Verify Alarms Rescheduled
  9. Enable Biometric → Lock App → Unlock → Access Data
  10. Multiple Notes → Search → Filter by Tag → Sort

================================================================================
STARTING PHASE 3 VERIFICATION
================================================================================

Proceeding with Batch 1: Flows 1-8 (App Launch & Basic Note Operations)

Next: Examine code for each flow to confirm integration
